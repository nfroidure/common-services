/* Architecture Note #1: Services

Since the services in this module are very common, we
 provide a helper to require them all with a single
 line of code.

Their goal is to encapsulate unpredictible states and
 inputs/outputs of the software they are part of. They
 are primarily meant to be used with
 [`knifecycle`](https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle)
 but should be usable with any DI system or even rawly.
